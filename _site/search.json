One of the last migrants to arrive in the spring, with the first record this year on the 10th of May at North Haugh Pond; similarly early to leave in the autumn, with the last record for the year on the 28th of August on Saint Leonard’s Road. Commonly seen flying overhead all throughout the patch, either as individuals or in flocks of up to several dozen birds at a time; the highest count for the year was of 53 birds over North Haugh Pond on the 20th of July. No breeding behaviours observed, although probably bred on the patch somewhere."

It is difficult to say with certainty what this species’ status on the patch is, given the somewhat perplexing pattern of occurrence throughout the year. The majority of records of the species came from North Haugh Pond during autumn and winter, with two birds present around the pond from early October to the end of the year; the same pattern of occurrence in late 2023 at the pond suggests this may be a regular annual occurrence. In addition, two birds were seen in Lumbo Den on the 1st of June; given how infrequently I birded in these woods throughout the year they may be more regular there, but it is hard to say with certainty whether birds are resident in the patch or whether they just move through from time to time."

Like Common Kingfisher, this species’ status on the patch is somewhat perplexing. Birds seemingly disappeared from their usual haunts along the Lade Braes during the summer months, before returning again in autumn, suggesting that they may breed elsewhere (perhaps further up the Kinness Burn)? Nevertheless, a reliable sight along the Burn in the cooler months of the year, with one or two birds usually present (and a high count of four birds seen on the 21st of January)."

Highlights included the first Corn Bunting territory in St Andrews in modern times (my first observation in the fields south-east of town on the 25th), my only spring records of Northern Wheatear (at Out Head on the 6th) and Barnacle Goose (at Balgove Bay on the 19th), the last records of a handful of late-departing winter migrants: Eurasian Wigeon (at Balgove Bay on the 19th), Long-tailed Duck (at Out Head on the 19th), Ruddy Turnstone (at the Aquarium on the 5th), Red Knot (at Balgove Bay on the 4th), Sanderling (at Out Head on the 6th), and Purple Sandpiper (at Out Head on the 6th), and the arrival of a few late-returning summer migrants: Common Swift (at North Haugh Pond on the 10th), Osprey (at Out Head on the 6th), Sedge Warbler (at Out Head on the 2nd), and Greater Whitethroat (at Out Head on the 2nd)."

Highlights included out-of-season records of Brant (2 at Balgove Bay on the 17th), Canada Goose (18 over North Haugh Pond on the 5th), and Eurasian Jay (2 in Lumbo Den on the 1st), as well as the first record of Arctic Tern for the year (off the Aquarium on the 18th), and the arrival of a pair of Eurasian Coot at North Haugh Pond (first seen on the 3rd) that remained throughout the summer and ultimately bred."

Total effort slightly reduced once again due to a trip to Wales in the middle of the month. The undeniable star of the month was a Lesser Yellowlegs found on the 24th down by The Scores (twitched by me later that evening); this was only the second Fife record of the species, and the bird showed well on the rocks around Castle Sands for more than a week. Other highlights included Common Sandpiper (also on the rocks by The Scores during the same period, first seen on the 23rd), the first Parasitic Jaeger for the autumn (off the Aquarium on the 28th), a handful of Little Gull sightings (off the Aquarium on the 9th, The Scores on the 10th, and a flock of 9 at Out Head on the 21st), the first Manx Shearwater for the autumn (off The Scores on the 5th), and what turned out to be my last record of European Shag for the year (at the Aquarium on the 25th)."

The best find of the month was a Red Phalarope down on Balgove Bay late in the evening of the 27th, an unusual record both due to its timing (very early in the autumn) and location (in the estuary, rather than offshore). Other highlights included the Lesser Yellowlegs and Common Sandpiper continuing down by The Scores at the start of the month, the passage of Canada Goose (first seen on the 13th at home) and Whimbrel (first seen on the 1st at Out Head) through the patch, the (rather late) arrival of Common Tern (off the Aquarium on the 11th), a Short-eared Owl lingering around the Eden Estuary (first seen at Out Head on the 1st), and my only autumn record of Northern Wheatear (at North Haugh Pond on the 11th)."

The major highlights of the month were a Sooty Shearwater off The Scores on the 26th, and a juvenile Ruff on Balgove Bay in the morning of the 28th. Other highlights included the arrival of a number of winter waterfowl: Pink-footed Goose (over North Haugh Pond on the 24th), Barnacle Goose (over the Aquarium on the 26th), Eurasian Wigeon (down at Balgove Bay on the 28th), Northern Pintail (also at Balgove Bay on the 28th), Greater Scaup (Balgove Bay on the 28th), Long-tailed Duck (Balgove Bay on the 29th), and Horned Grebe (Balgove Bay on the 29th), and the departure of a couple of summer migrants: Common Tern (last seen off The Scores on the 26th) and Western House-Martin (at North Haugh Pond on the 30th)."

The major highlight was my only Great Skua for the year, flying past the Aquarium on the 1st. Other highlights included my first of two Western Barn Owl records, this one a fortuitous sighting on the evening of the 23rd at the start of the Strathkinness Low Road, and the return of Eurasian Jay to North Haugh Pond (first seen on the 4th, with several records throughout the month). Winter migrants continued to arrive, with Whooper Swan at Balgove Bay on the 13th, Velvet Scoter off the Aquarium on the 8th, Purple Sandpiper by the Aquarium on the 9th, Great Crested Grebe off the Aquarium on the 8th, and Redwing at the Observatory on the 9th. Similarly, the last summer migrants disappeared throughout the month, with Eurasian Coot last at North Haugh Pond on the 3rd, Barn Swallow similarly last at North Haugh Pond on the 13th, and Eurasian Blackcap at North Haugh Pond on the 10th."

The first of two major highlights was an Iceland Gull off the Aquarium on the 4th, found late in the evening in fading light and not relocated on subsequent visits. The second highlight was a distant Red-necked Grebe twitched off the Aquarium on the 26th (in rather better light, thankfully); on the same day I picked up my first Atlantic Puffin for the year, part of an influx into the patch that continued through December. Other highlights included a handful of Dovekie (also off the Aquarium, with the first bird on the 16th), a late Sandwich Tern (off the Aquarium on the 7th), a number of Common Loon sightings (off both the Aquarium and The Scores), a family of Tawny Owl by home on the 14th, a Common Raven pair down by the Aquarium on the 5th, my first Fieldfare for the second winter period (a flock of 67 at North Haugh Pond on the 24th), and my second and third Redpoll sightings for the year (singles at North Haugh Pond on the 4th and 15th)."

Other highlights included an unusual Tufted Duck sighting (at Balgove Bay on the 14th), a Common Snipe at North Haugh Pond (on the 8th), five Atlantic Puffin in St Andrews Bay (singles off the Aquarium on the 14th and 23rd, and 3 together off The Scores on the 14th), a final Dovekie sighting (off the Aquarium on the 21st), a Western Barn Owl near North Haugh Pond on Christmas night, and an out-of-season Common Chiffchaff that hung around North Haugh Pond for a couple of days at the end of the month (first found on the 20th)."
