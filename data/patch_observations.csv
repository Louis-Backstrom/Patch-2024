My initial impression of the bird upon picking it up was “what is that” – alarm bells were immediately ringing in my head, as this bird did not look like any of the other waders onsite (and indeed, any wader that I had ever seen). My impression was of a very pale grey and white bird about a third to half the size (minus the tail) of the Common Terns it was next to, with a rather upright posture (vaguely recalling a Tringa wader), black bill, white head with black markings around the eyes and on the back of the neck (vaguely recalling a moulting Black-headed Gull – but obviously not that species!).     Upon closer inspection, these are the features I could discern:  Structure: somewhat wader-like, but slender (not round like e.g. most Calidris species), slightly long-necked and with a small head. Legs fairly short (proportionally shorter than e.g. nearby Redshank).  Posture: upright, vaguely recalling a Tringa wader.  Plumage: very pale overall, with white underparts and head, a plain grey back with no apparent white stripes (i.e. not like adult winter Red-necked Phalarope), a black mark behind the eyes and on the back of the neck extending to the top (but not front) of the head. In flight, obvious white wing bar (i.e. not like Wilson’s Phalarope)  Bill: black, not noticeably long nor thin – about the same length as the head. I did not see any yellow at the base but given the distance to the bird and the backlit conditions I don’t think this is surprising; I also was not aware of this as a diagnostic feature at the time of the observation so wasn’t searching for it.  Legs: colour not noted at the time, but my recollection is that they were a fairly neutral colour (although I tend to have trouble with leg colour in waders at a distance).  Flight style: immediately distinctive – at the time I called it “jittery” – small perturbations from direct flight (not so much as to be considered “erratic”, for example). Unlike the flight style of any of the other waders at the site.    ID contenders:  Red-necked Phalarope: most likely confusion species. Ruled out in this instance on the basis of plumage (plainer than Red-necked, with no sign of any white stripes or feather fringing on the back) and bill structure (shorter and thicker than Red-necked). Circumstances (see below) also suggest Grey as the more likely species to have occurred in Fife at this time.  Wilson’s Phalarope: more distinctive than Grey/Red-necked, and considerably rarer. Ruled out in this instance on the basis of plumage (black markings on head and obvious white wing bar in flight, not present in Wilson’s), body structure (shorter legs and slightly shorter neck than Wilson’s) and bill structure (shorter and thicker than Wilson’s). Circumstances also suggest Grey as the far more likely species to have occurred in Fife at this time.  Sanderling: most common confusion species, but least alike. Ruled out in this instance on the basis of plumage (black markings on head, not present in Sanderling), body structure (slender, longer-necked and smaller-headed than a Sanderling), bill structure (straight, not downcurved like in Sanderling), and flight style (as described above).    In conclusion: all the features I could discern on the bird support the identification as a winter-plumaged adult Grey Phalarope.    Record to be submitted to Fife Local Records Committee.",NA,NA

First seen around 16:00 as it landed on the water. In flight (seen only for about half a second before it landed), greyish wings with white wingtips and no visible black on primaries. Settled on water with the roosting gull flock where I watched it for about fifteen minutes hoping to see it move again or show its wings more obviously, but no luck. At rest, appeared roughly the same size, perhaps slightly smaller, than surrounding European Herring Gulls, but more dainty (recalling Common Gull) and slender, with longer wings projecting past tail. When sitting on the water, still no sign of any black on wingtips (all white), with grey mantle slightly paler than surrounding European Herring Gulls. Head looked ""cute"" (once again recalling Common Gull), at distance (and with rapidly fading light) hard to discern too many more plumage features but head appeared mostly unmarked, with perhaps a bit of dark streaking coming in behind the eye.    Although unfamiliar with Iceland Gull (this would be a lifer), I believe this is the best ID for this individual. Nearly all other plausible gull species / age classes would show some black on the primaries (either in flight or at rest). Glaucous Gull (also a Fife rarity) would appear more bulky, and larger next to surrounding European Herring Gulls; Mediterranean Gull (also unusual near St Andrews, but present elsewhere in Fife) would appear noticeably smaller and with different structure to the Common Gull-like structure of this bird.",NA,NA

At first I thought it was perhaps a Goshawk, as the bird seemed larger than other Sparrowhawks I've seen around St Andrews (reminiscent of a Brown Goshawk from Australia). However once it perched it seemed more like a Sparrowhawk, although views were poor and I could only see its back. From what I could make out the colour on the back seemed greyer (rather than more leaden in a Goshawk), and the front seemed to be barred with orange (like a Sparrowhawk should be). That, plus the overall rarity of Goshawks around Fife suggest that this probably was just a Sparrowhawk - maybe a large female (or maybe I just can't gauge size!).",NA,NA
