The major highlights were my only records of [**Water Rail**](species_accounts.qmd#water-rail) (by [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158226046)), [**White-tailed Eagle**](species_accounts.qmd#white-tailed-eagle) (on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158767779)), and [**Eurasian Woodcock**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-woodcock) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [22nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159524664)). Other notable sightings included [**Common Snipe**](species_accounts.qmd#common-snipe) (by [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [20th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159349278)), [**Little Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#little-gull) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158230523)), [**Little Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#little-grebe) (off [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock) on the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159892778)), [**European Shag**](species_accounts.qmd#european-shag) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159336429)), [**Common Kingfisher**](species_accounts.qmd){#common-kingfisher} (at [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock) on the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159892778)), [**Common Raven**](species_accounts.qmd#common-raven) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158494195) and [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159752070), the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158619060), and by [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes) on the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159909581)), and an out-of-season [**Eurasian Blackcap**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-blackcap) (along [Saint Leonards Road](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-road) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158757516)).\n\n## February\n\n**101** species (**9** new) across **118** complete checklists. **44.1** total hours of effort across **29** patch days, covering **83.6** km.\n\nA slightly better month than January in terms of species tally, but somewhat diminished in terms of quality. The standout bird of the month was my only record of [**Bohemian Waxwing**](species_accounts.qmd#bohemian-waxwing) (a flock of 7 twitched [between Swilken Burn and Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#swilken-burn-to-balgove-bay) on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S162613053)). Other notable sightings included my first of three [**Redpoll**](species_accounts.qmd#redpoll) sightings for the year (5 birds at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S160769519)), [**Common Raven**](species_accounts.qmd#common-raven) continuing at [North Haugh Pond](species_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S160769519), [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S160914196), [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161107512), and [18th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161956481)) for a couple of weeks before disappearing, a [**Little Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#little-gull) at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161015791) in the middle of a storm, and the first returns of two (primarily) summer migrants to the patch: [**Lesser Black-backed Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-black-backed-gull) (first at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [17th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161779921)) and [**Northern Gannet**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-gannet) (first off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S163241804)).\n\n## March\n\n**98** species (**5** new) across **108** complete checklists. **42** total hours of effort across **31** patch days, covering **81.9** km.\n\nA quiet month, with less than 100 species recorded and few sightings of any great note (every species recorded in March was also recorded in at least one other month). Highlights included my only record of [**Whooper Swan**](species_accounts.qmd#whooper-swan) for the first half of the year (4 birds off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S163550161)), first records of [**Short-eared Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#short-eared-owl) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166469104)) and [**Tawny Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#tawny-owl) (at [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166560724)), last records (for the first winter period) of [**Velvet Scoter**](species_accounts.qmd#velvet-scoter) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [17th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S165138549)) and [**Common Greenshank**](species_accounts.qmd#common-greenshank) (by the [Coastal Path](site_accounts.qmd#coastal-path-from-st-andrews) on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S165667222)), and the first returns of a handful of summer migrants to the patch, all at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond): [**Common Chiffchaff**](species_accounts.qmd#common-chiffchaff) (first on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S164063094)), [**Eurasian Blackcap**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-blackcap) ([29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166358473)), and [**Bank Swallow**](species_accounts.qmd#bank-swallow) ([30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166447977)).\n\n## April\n\n**97** species (**8** new) across **93** complete checklists. **35.6** total hours of effort across **25** patch days, covering **58.7** km.\n\nA below-average month in terms of species observed (partially owing to time spent off-patch in the Highlands), but with a number of highlights. The two standouts were my only records of [**Black-tailed Godwit**](species_accounts.qmd#black-tailed-godwit) (a flock of 11 at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S167346185)) and [**Common Redstart**](species_accounts.qmd#common-redstart) (twitched on [Watson Avenue](site_accounts.qmd#watson-avenue) on the [12th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168253583)) for the year. Other notable sightings included the first of a number of [**Common Loon**](species_accounts.qmd#common-loon) sightings for the year (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169609857)), the last records of a number of winter migrants: [**Pink-footed Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#pink-footed-goose) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168141127)), [**Northern Pintail**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-pintail) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756)), [**Greater Scaup**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-scaup) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [22nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169813245)), [**Black-bellied Plover**](species_accounts.qmd#black-bellied-plover) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756)), [**Common Redshank**](species_accounts.qmd#common-redshank) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756)), [**Horned Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#horned-grebe) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756)), [**Great Crested Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#great-crested-grebe) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756)), and [**Redwing**](species_accounts.qmd#redwing) (at the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S167016467)), and first records for several summer migrants: [**Sandwich Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#sandwich-tern) (at [East Sands](site_accounts.qmd#east-sands) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168355008)), [**Barn Swallow**](species_accounts.qmd#barn-swallow) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169258999)), [**Western House-Martin**](species_accounts.qmd#western-house-martin) (on the [Coastal Path](site_accounts.qmd#coastal-path-from-st-andrews) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169584684)), and [**Willow Warbler**](species_accounts.qmd#willow-warbler) (on [Watson Avenue](site_accounts.qmd#watson-avenue) on the [12th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168253583)).\n\n## May\n\n**98** species (**8** new) across **100** complete checklists. **43.4** total hours of effort across **29** patch days, covering **74.4** km.\n\nAn exciting month with plenty of migratory and breeding activity, but ultimately little payoff in patch listing terms, with less than 100 species recorded and none unique to the month. Highlights included the first [**Corn Bunting**](species_accounts.qmd#corn-bunting) territory in St Andrews in modern times (my first observation in the [fields south-east of town](site_accounts.qmd#a917-between-lamond-drive-and-b9131) on the [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S176936176)), my only spring records of [**Northern Wheatear**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-wheatear) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)) and [**Barnacle Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#barnacle-goose) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175534249)), the last records of a handful of late-departing winter migrants: [**Eurasian Wigeon**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-wigeon) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175534249)), [**Long-tailed Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#long-tailed-duck) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175548979)), [**Ruddy Turnstone**](species_accounts.qmd#ruddy-turnstone) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172102084)), [**Red Knot**](species_accounts.qmd#red-knot) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171836610)), [**Sanderling**](species_accounts.qmd#sanderling) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), and [**Purple Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#purple-sandpiper) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), and the arrival of a few late-returning summer migrants: [**Common Swift**](species_accounts.qmd#common-swift) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S173233509)), [**Osprey**](species_accounts.qmd#osprey) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), [**Sedge Warbler**](species_accounts.qmd#sedge-warbler) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [2nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171452781)), and [**Greater Whitethroat**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-whitethroat) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [2nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171452781)).\n\n## June\n\n**91** species (**4** new) across **79** complete checklists. **32.8** total hours of effort across **21** patch days, covering **59.7** km.\n\nOne of the quietest months of the year, with the lowest tally and no unique species, although total effort was reduced owing to a trip to Switzerland in the latter half of the month. Highlights included out-of-season records of [**Brant**](species_accounts.qmd#brant) (2 at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [17th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S182127205)), [**Canada Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#canada-goose) (18 over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S179593467)), and [**Eurasian Jay**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-jay) (2 in [Lumbo Den](site_accounts.qmd#lumbo-den) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S178540214)), as well as the first record of [**Arctic Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#arctic-tern) for the year (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [18th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S182280218)), and the arrival of a pair of [**Eurasian Coot**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-coot) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (first seen on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S179215499)) that remained throughout the summer and ultimately bred.\n\n## July\n\n**100** species (**4** new) across **96** complete checklists. **42.1** total hours of effort across **26** patch days, covering **63.2** km.\n\nA solid month with a reasonable tally and some quality sightings, although once again no unique species. Total effort slightly reduced once again due to a trip to Wales in the middle of the month. The undeniable star of the month was a [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) found on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188621552) down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) (twitched by me later that evening); this was only the second Fife record of the species, and the bird showed well on the rocks around Castle Sands for more than a week. Other highlights included [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) (also on the rocks by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) during the same period, first seen on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188399567)), the first [**Parasitic Jaeger**](species_accounts.qmd#parasitic-jaeger) for the autumn (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189312763)), a handful of [**Little Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#little-gull) sightings (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186221010), [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186370766), and a flock of 9 at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188040692)), the first [**Manx Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#manx-shearwater) for the autumn (off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S185496682)), and what turned out to be my last record of [**European Shag**](species_accounts.qmd#european-shag) for the year (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188796421)).\n\n## August\n\n**103** species (**2** new) across **109** complete checklists. **48.3** total hours of effort across **26** patch days, covering **74.8** km.\n\nOne of the best months of the year, with a high tally and a number of good species seen. The best find of the month was a [**Red Phalarope**](species_accounts.qmd#red-phalarope) down on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) late in the evening of the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S192988182), an unusual record both due to its timing (very early in the autumn) and location (in the estuary, rather than offshore). Other highlights included the [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) and [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) continuing down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) at the start of the month, the passage of [**Canada Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#canada-goose) (first seen on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191260534) at [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage)) and [**Whimbrel**](species_accounts.qmd#whimbrel) (first seen on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295) at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head)) through the patch, the (rather late) arrival of [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191079476)), a [**Short-eared Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#short-eared-owl) lingering around the Eden Estuary (first seen at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295)), and my only autumn record of [**Northern Wheatear**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-wheatear) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S190993291)).\n\n## September\n\n**92** species (**2** new) across **20** complete checklists. **11.7** total hours of effort across **6** patch days, covering **15.1** km.\n\nA quiet month, but mostly due to being off-patch in Australia for all but the last week or so; this may well have been one of the best months of the year if I'd been around for more of it. The major highlights of the month were a [**Sooty Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#sooty-shearwater) off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367), and a juvenile [**Ruff**](species_accounts.qmd#ruff) on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) in the morning of the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312). Other highlights included the arrival of a number of winter waterfowl: [**Pink-footed Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#pink-footed-goose) (over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196306502)), [**Barnacle Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#barnacle-goose) (over the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196555447)), [**Eurasian Wigeon**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-wigeon) (down at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Northern Pintail**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-pintail) (also at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Greater Scaup**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-scaup) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Long-tailed Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#long-tailed-duck) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and [**Horned Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#horned-grebe) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and the departure of a couple of summer migrants: [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (last seen off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367)) and [**Western House-Martin**](species_accounts.qmd#western-house-martin) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196995430)).\n\n## October\n\n**109** species (**2** new) across **93** complete checklists. **43.8** total hours of effort across **31** patch days, covering **64.9** km.\n\nA very good month, with the highest species tally for the year and a number of good birds found. The major highlight was my only **Great Skua** for the year, flying past the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197110964). Other highlights included my first of two **Western Barn Owl** records, this one a fortuitous sighting on the evening of the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S200014845) at the start of the [Strathkinness Low Road](site_accounts.qmd##b939-buchanan-gardens-and-strathkinness-low-road), and the return of **Eurasian Jay** to [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (first seen on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197433457), with several records throughout the month). Winter migrants continued to arrive, with **Whooper Swan** at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198680575), **Velvet Scoter** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), **Purple Sandpiper** by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198130876), **Great Crested Grebe** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), and **Redwing** at the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198082343). Similarly, the last summer migrants disappeared throughout the month, with **Eurasian Coot** last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197371440), **Barn Swallow** similarly last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198660998), and **Eurasian Blackcap** at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198189447).\n\n## November\n\n**108** species (**4** new) across **71** complete checklists. **33.2** total hours of effort across **30** patch days, covering **51.5** km.\n\nPerhaps the best month of the year, and almost entirely due to a number of great birds seen off the Aquarium at various points throughout the month. The first of two major highlights was an [**Iceland Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#iceland-gull) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201396768), found late in the evening in fading light and not relocated on subsequent visits. The second highlight was a distant [**Red-necked Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#red-necked-grebe) twitched off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203664428) (in rather better light, thankfully); on the same day I picked up my first [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) for the year, part of an influx into the patch that continued through December. Other highlights included a handful of [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) (also off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with the first bird on the [16th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202659009)), a late [**Sandwich Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#sandwich-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [7th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201644875)), a number of [**Common Loon**](species_accounts.qmd#common-loon) sightings (off both the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) and [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores)), a family of [**Tawny Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#tawny-owl) by [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202501268), a [**Common Raven**](species_accounts.qmd#common-raven) pair down by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201454703), my first [**Fieldfare**](species_accounts.qmd#fieldfare) for the second winter period (a flock of 67 at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203440691)), and my second and third [**Redpoll**](species_accounts.qmd#redpoll) sightings for the year (singles at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201354098) and [15th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202524247)).\n\n## December\n\n**102** species (**1** new) across **80** complete checklists. **38.4** total hours of effort across **31** patch days, covering **61** km.\n\nA fairly subdued end to the year, with a reasonable species tally but only a handful of noteworthy sightings. The major highlight of the month was a [**Black Guillemot**](species_accounts.qmd#black-guillemot) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th](#0), completing the set of all 5 regular British auk species on the patch, and being my final addition to the year list. Other highlights included an unusual [**Tufted Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#tufted-duck) sighting (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205324954)), a [**Common Snipe**](species_accounts.qmd#common-snipe) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S204799357)), five [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) in St Andrews Bay (singles off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205331974) and [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206287426), and 3 together off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205339551)), a final [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) sighting (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206062088)), a [**Western Barn Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#western-barn-owl) near [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on [Christmas night](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206563196), and an out-of-season [**Common Chiffchaff**](species_accounts.qmd#common-chiffchaff) that hung around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) for a couple of days at the end of the month (first found on the [20th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205971032)).\n",
