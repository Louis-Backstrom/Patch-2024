Highlights included the first [**Corn Bunting**](species_accounts.qmd#corn-bunting) territory in St Andrews in modern times (my first observation in the [fields south-east of town](site_accounts.qmd#a917-between-lamond-drive-and-b9131) on the [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S176936176)), my only spring records of [**Northern Wheatear**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-wheatear) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)) and [**Barnacle Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#barnacle-goose) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175534249)), the last records of a handful of late-departing winter migrants: [**Eurasian Wigeon**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-wigeon) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175534249)), [**Long-tailed Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#long-tailed-duck) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [19th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S175548979)), [**Ruddy Turnstone**](species_accounts.qmd#ruddy-turnstone) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172102084)), [**Red Knot**](species_accounts.qmd#red-knot) (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171836610)), [**Sanderling**](species_accounts.qmd#sanderling) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), and [**Purple Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#purple-sandpiper) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), and the arrival of a few late-returning summer migrants: [**Common Swift**](species_accounts.qmd#common-swift) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S173233509)), [**Osprey**](species_accounts.qmd#osprey) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952)), [**Sedge Warbler**](species_accounts.qmd#sedge-warbler) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [2nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171452781)), and [**Greater Whitethroat**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-whitethroat) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [2nd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171452781)).\n\n## June\n\n**`{r} patch_months[6, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[6, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[6, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[6, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[6, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[6, 6]`** km.\n\nOne of the quietest months of the year, with the lowest tally and no unique species, although total effort was reduced owing to a trip to Switzerland in the latter half of the month. Highlights included out-of-season records of [**Brant**](species_accounts.qmd#brant) (2 at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [17th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S182127205)), [**Canada Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#canada-goose) (18 over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S179593467)), and [**Eurasian Jay**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-jay) (2 in [Lumbo Den](site_accounts.qmd#lumbo-den) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S178540214)), as well as the first record of [**Arctic Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#arctic-tern) for the year (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [18th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S182280218)), and the arrival of a pair of [**Eurasian Coot**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-coot) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (first seen on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S179215499)) that remained throughout the summer and ultimately bred.\n\n## July\n\n**`{r} patch_months[7, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[7, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[7, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[7, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[7, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[7, 6]`** km.\n\nA solid month with a reasonable tally and some quality sightings, although once again no unique species. Total effort slightly reduced once again due to a trip to Wales in the middle of the month. The undeniable star of the month was a [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) found on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188621552) down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) (twitched by me later that evening); this was only the second Fife record of the species, and the bird showed well on the rocks around Castle Sands for more than a week. Other highlights included [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) (also on the rocks by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) during the same period, first seen on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188399567)), the first [**Parasitic Jaeger**](species_accounts.qmd#parasitic-jaeger) for the autumn (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189312763)), a handful of [**Little Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#little-gull) sightings (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186221010), [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186370766), and a flock of 9 at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188040692)), the first [**Manx Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#manx-shearwater) for the autumn (off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S185496682)), and what turned out to be my last record of [**European Shag**](species_accounts.qmd#european-shag) for the year (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188796421)).\n\n## August\n\n**`{r} patch_months[8, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[8, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[8, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[8, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[8, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[8, 6]`** km.\n\nOne of the best months of the year, with a high tally and a number of good species seen. The best find of the month was a [**Red Phalarope**](species_accounts.qmd#red-phalarope) down on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) late in the evening of the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S192988182), an unusual record both due to its timing (very early in the autumn) and location (in the estuary, rather than offshore). Other highlights included the [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) and [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) continuing down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) at the start of the month, the passage of [**Canada Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#canada-goose) (first seen on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191260534) at [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage)) and [**Whimbrel**](species_accounts.qmd#whimbrel) (first seen on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295) at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head)) through the patch, the (rather late) arrival of [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191079476)), a [**Short-eared Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#short-eared-owl) lingering around the Eden Estuary (first seen at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295)), and my only autumn record of [**Northern Wheatear**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-wheatear) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S190993291)).\n\n## September\n\n**`{r} patch_months[9, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[9, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[9, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[9, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[9, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[9, 6]`** km.\n\nA quiet month, but mostly due to being off-patch in Australia for all but the last week or so; this may well have been one of the best months of the year if I'd been around for more of it. The major highlights of the month were a [**Sooty Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#sooty-shearwater) off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367), and a juvenile [**Ruff**](species_accounts.qmd#ruff) on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) in the morning of the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312). Other highlights included the arrival of a number of winter waterfowl: [**Pink-footed Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#pink-footed-goose) (over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196306502)), [**Barnacle Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#barnacle-goose) (over the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196555447)), [**Eurasian Wigeon**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-wigeon) (down at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Northern Pintail**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-pintail) (also at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Greater Scaup**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-scaup) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Long-tailed Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#long-tailed-duck) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and [**Horned Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#horned-grebe) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and the departure of a couple of summer migrants: [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (last seen off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367)) and [**Western House-Martin**](species_accounts.qmd#western-house-martin) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196995430)).\n\n## October\n\n**`{r} patch_months[10, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[10, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[10, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[10, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[10, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[10, 6]`** km.\n\nA very good month, with the highest species tally for the year and a number of good birds found. The major highlight was my only **Great Skua** for the year, flying past the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197110964). Other highlights included my first of two **Western Barn Owl** records, this one a fortuitous sighting on the evening of the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S200014845) at the start of the [Strathkinness Low Road](site_accounts.qmd##b939-buchanan-gardens-and-strathkinness-low-road), and the return of **Eurasian Jay** to [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (first seen on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197433457), with several records throughout the month). Winter migrants continued to arrive, with **Whooper Swan** at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198680575), **Velvet Scoter** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), **Purple Sandpiper** by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198130876), **Great Crested Grebe** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), and **Redwing** at the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198082343). Similarly, the last summer migrants disappeared throughout the month, with **Eurasian Coot** last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197371440), **Barn Swallow** similarly last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198660998), and **Eurasian Blackcap** at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198189447).\n\n## November\n\n**`{r} patch_months[11, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[11, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[11, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[11, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[11, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[11, 6]`** km.\n\nPerhaps the best month of the year, and almost entirely due to a number of great birds seen off the Aquarium at various points throughout the month. The first of two major highlights was an [**Iceland Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#iceland-gull) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201396768), found late in the evening in fading light and not relocated on subsequent visits. The second highlight was a distant [**Red-necked Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#red-necked-grebe) twitched off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203664428) (in rather better light, thankfully); on the same day I picked up my first [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) for the year, part of an influx into the patch that continued through December. Other highlights included a handful of [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) (also off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with the first bird on the [16th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202659009)), a late [**Sandwich Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#sandwich-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [7th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201644875)), a number of [**Common Loon**](species_accounts.qmd#common-loon) sightings (off both the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) and [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores)), a family of [**Tawny Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#tawny-owl) by [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202501268), a [**Common Raven**](species_accounts.qmd#common-raven) pair down by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201454703), my first [**Fieldfare**](species_accounts.qmd#fieldfare) for the second winter period (a flock of 67 at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203440691)), and my second and third [**Redpoll**](species_accounts.qmd#redpoll) sightings for the year (singles at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201354098) and [15th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202524247)).\n\n## December\n\n**`{r} patch_months[12, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[12, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[12, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[12, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[12, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[12, 6]`** km.\n\nA fairly subdued end to the year, with a reasonable species tally but only a handful of noteworthy sightings. The major highlight of the month was a [**Black Guillemot**](species_accounts.qmd#black-guillemot) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th](#0), completing the set of all 5 regular British auk species on the patch, and being my final addition to the year list. Other highlights included an unusual [**Tufted Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#tufted-duck) sighting (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205324954)), a [**Common Snipe**](species_accounts.qmd#common-snipe) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S204799357)), five [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) in St Andrews Bay (singles off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205331974) and [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206287426), and 3 together off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205339551)), a final [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) sighting (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206062088)), a [**Western Barn Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#western-barn-owl) near [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on [Christmas night](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206563196), and an out-of-season [**Common Chiffchaff**](species_accounts.qmd#common-chiffchaff) that hung around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) for a couple of days at the end of the month (first found on the [20th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205971032)).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nload(\"data/patch_months.RData\")\n```\n\n## January\n\n**`{r} patch_months[1, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[1, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[1, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[1, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[1, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[1, 6]`** km.\n\nA solid start to the year, despite recording less than 100 species throughout the month.

Highlights included my only record of [**Whooper Swan**](species_accounts.qmd#whooper-swan) for the first half of the year (4 birds off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S163550161)), first records of [**Short-eared Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#short-eared-owl) (at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166469104)) and [**Tawny Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#tawny-owl) (at [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166560724)), last records (for the first winter period) of [**Velvet Scoter**](species_accounts.qmd#velvet-scoter) (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [17th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S165138549)) and [**Common Greenshank**](species_accounts.qmd#common-greenshank) (by the [Coastal Path](site_accounts.qmd#coastal-path-from-st-andrews) on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S165667222)), and the first returns of a handful of summer migrants to the patch, all at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond): [**Common Chiffchaff**](species_accounts.qmd#common-chiffchaff) (first on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S164063094)), [**Eurasian Blackcap**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-blackcap) ([29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166358473)), and [**Bank Swallow**](species_accounts.qmd#bank-swallow) ([30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S166447977)).\n\n## April\n\n**`{r} patch_months[4, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[4, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[4, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[4, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[4, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[4, 6]`** km.\n\nA below-average month in terms of species observed (partially owing to time spent off-patch in the Highlands), but with a number of highlights. The two standouts were my only records of [**Black-tailed Godwit**](species_accounts.qmd#black-tailed-godwit) (a flock of 11 at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [6th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S167346185)) and [**Common Redstart**](species_accounts.qmd#common-redstart) (twitched on [Watson Avenue](site_accounts.qmd#watson-avenue) on the [12th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168253583)) for the year.

Total effort slightly reduced once again due to a trip to Wales in the middle of the month. The undeniable star of the month was a [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) found on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188621552) down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) (twitched by me later that evening); this was only the second Fife record of the species, and the bird showed well on the rocks around Castle Sands for more than a week. Other highlights included [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) (also on the rocks by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) during the same period, first seen on the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188399567)), the first [**Parasitic Jaeger**](species_accounts.qmd#parasitic-jaeger) for the autumn (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189312763)), a handful of [**Little Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#little-gull) sightings (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186221010), [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S186370766), and a flock of 9 at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188040692)), the first [**Manx Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#manx-shearwater) for the autumn (off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S185496682)), and what turned out to be my last record of [**European Shag**](species_accounts.qmd#european-shag) for the year (at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [25th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188796421)).\n\n## August\n\n**`{r} patch_months[8, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[8, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[8, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[8, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[8, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[8, 6]`** km.\n\nOne of the best months of the year, with a high tally and a number of good species seen. The best find of the month was a [**Red Phalarope**](species_accounts.qmd#red-phalarope) down on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) late in the evening of the [27th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S192988182), an unusual record both due to its timing (very early in the autumn) and location (in the estuary, rather than offshore). Other highlights included the [**Lesser Yellowlegs**](species_accounts.qmd#lesser-yellowlegs) and [**Common Sandpiper**](species_accounts.qmd#common-sandpiper) continuing down by [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) at the start of the month, the passage of [**Canada Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#canada-goose) (first seen on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191260534) at [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage)) and [**Whimbrel**](species_accounts.qmd#whimbrel) (first seen on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295) at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head)) through the patch, the (rather late) arrival of [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191079476)), a [**Short-eared Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#short-eared-owl) lingering around the Eden Estuary (first seen at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189819295)), and my only autumn record of [**Northern Wheatear**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-wheatear) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [11th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S190993291)).\n\n## September\n\n**`{r} patch_months[9, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[9, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[9, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[9, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[9, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[9, 6]`** km.\n\nA quiet month, but mostly due to being off-patch in Australia for all but the last week or so; this may well have been one of the best months of the year if I'd been around for more of it. The major highlights of the month were a [**Sooty Shearwater**](species_accounts.qmd#sooty-shearwater) off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367), and a juvenile [**Ruff**](species_accounts.qmd#ruff) on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) in the morning of the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312). Other highlights included the arrival of a number of winter waterfowl: [**Pink-footed Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#pink-footed-goose) (over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196306502)), [**Barnacle Goose**](species_accounts.qmd#barnacle-goose) (over the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196555447)), [**Eurasian Wigeon**](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-wigeon) (down at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Northern Pintail**](species_accounts.qmd#northern-pintail) (also at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Greater Scaup**](species_accounts.qmd#greater-scaup) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [28th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312)), [**Long-tailed Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#long-tailed-duck) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and [**Horned Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#horned-grebe) ([Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128)), and the departure of a couple of summer migrants: [**Common Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#common-tern) (last seen off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367)) and [**Western House-Martin**](species_accounts.qmd#western-house-martin) (at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [30th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196995430)).\n\n## October\n\n**`{r} patch_months[10, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[10, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[10, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[10, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[10, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[10, 6]`** km.\n\nA very good month, with the highest species tally for the year and a number of good birds found. The major highlight was my only **Great Skua** for the year, flying past the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [1st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197110964). Other highlights included my first of two **Western Barn Owl** records, this one a fortuitous sighting on the evening of the [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S200014845) at the start of the [Strathkinness Low Road](site_accounts.qmd##b939-buchanan-gardens-and-strathkinness-low-road), and the return of **Eurasian Jay** to [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (first seen on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197433457), with several records throughout the month). Winter migrants continued to arrive, with **Whooper Swan** at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198680575), **Velvet Scoter** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), **Purple Sandpiper** by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198130876), **Great Crested Grebe** off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197977191), and **Redwing** at the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) on the [9th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198082343). Similarly, the last summer migrants disappeared throughout the month, with **Eurasian Coot** last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [3rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197371440), **Barn Swallow** similarly last at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [13th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198660998), and **Eurasian Blackcap** at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [10th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198189447).\n\n## November\n\n**`{r} patch_months[11, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[11, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[11, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[11, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[11, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[11, 6]`** km.\n\nPerhaps the best month of the year, and almost entirely due to a number of great birds seen off the Aquarium at various points throughout the month. The first of two major highlights was an [**Iceland Gull**](species_accounts.qmd#iceland-gull) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201396768), found late in the evening in fading light and not relocated on subsequent visits. The second highlight was a distant [**Red-necked Grebe**](species_accounts.qmd#red-necked-grebe) twitched off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [26th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203664428) (in rather better light, thankfully); on the same day I picked up my first [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) for the year, part of an influx into the patch that continued through December. Other highlights included a handful of [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) (also off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with the first bird on the [16th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202659009)), a late [**Sandwich Tern**](species_accounts.qmd#sandwich-tern) (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [7th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201644875)), a number of [**Common Loon**](species_accounts.qmd#common-loon) sightings (off both the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) and [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores)), a family of [**Tawny Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#tawny-owl) by [home](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-cottage) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202501268), a [**Common Raven**](species_accounts.qmd#common-raven) pair down by the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201454703), my first [**Fieldfare**](species_accounts.qmd#fieldfare) for the second winter period (a flock of 67 at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [24th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203440691)), and my second and third [**Redpoll**](species_accounts.qmd#redpoll) sightings for the year (singles at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [4th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201354098) and [15th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202524247)).\n\n## December\n\n**`{r} patch_months[12, 2]`** species (**`{r} patch_months[12, 7]`** new) across **`{r} patch_months[12, 3]`** complete checklists. **`{r} patch_months[12, 5]`** total hours of effort across **`{r} patch_months[12, 4]`** patch days, covering **`{r} patch_months[12, 6]`** km.\n\nA fairly subdued end to the year, with a reasonable species tally but only a handful of noteworthy sightings. The major highlight of the month was a [**Black Guillemot**](species_accounts.qmd#black-guillemot) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th](#0), completing the set of all 5 regular British auk species on the patch, and being my final addition to the year list. Other highlights included an unusual [**Tufted Duck**](species_accounts.qmd#tufted-duck) sighting (at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205324954)), a [**Common Snipe**](species_accounts.qmd#common-snipe) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) (on the [8th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S204799357)), five [**Atlantic Puffin**](species_accounts.qmd#atlantic-puffin) in St Andrews Bay (singles off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205331974) and [23rd](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206287426), and 3 together off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [14th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205339551)), a final [**Dovekie**](species_accounts.qmd#dovekie) sighting (off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [21st](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206062088)), a [**Western Barn Owl**](species_accounts.qmd#western-barn-owl) near [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on [Christmas night](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206563196), and an out-of-season [**Common Chiffchaff**](species_accounts.qmd#common-chiffchaff) that hung around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) for a couple of days at the end of the month (first found on the [20th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205971032)).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"month_accounts.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
