Rare visitor to the patch throughout the year. Mostly single birds, with a small flock on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [4th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171836610) and a pair at the same site on the [17th of August](https://ebird.org/checklist/S191745262). Perhaps surprising that I did not pick more birds up throughout the year, particularly during migration periods; I am unsure whether the birds seen on the patch this year come from the native population in the north-west, or introduced birds further south.

::::::

Common winter migrant and passage visitor. Most abundant during migration, particularly the southward autumn migration period from September to November, but also present throughout winter and spring. Last spring record on the [11th of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S168141127) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), first autumn record on the [24th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196306502) at the same location. Found throughout the patch, typically as flyover flocks. Often roosts on the Eden Estuary, and birds sometimes feed and roost in the field south and west of town.

Uncommon passage visitor, mostly during late autumn. Only one record during the northward spring migration, with a flock of 4 birds seen distantly off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [3rd of March](https://ebird.org/checklist/S163550161); half a dozen records during the autumn migration, beginning on the [13th of October](https://ebird.org/checklist/S198680575) at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) and culminating on the [24th of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206385653) at the same location. Most records pertaining to small flocks (less than two dozen birds) either flying over town or resting on the Eden Estuary.

Common resident, mostly localised to the Eden Estuary. Numbers varied throughout the year, with the highest counts at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) during late winter and early autumn, peaking at 284 birds on the [17th of February](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161813935). Bred nearby, if not on the patch, with a few chicks seen on the [17th of June](https://ebird.org/checklist/S182127205). Outside of the Eden Estuary, a couple of records of birds flying past St Andrews Bay, probably on their way to or from the Estuary.

One of the most widespread birds on the patch, found near just about any water source, as well as being often seen flying over town. Most abundant along the [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes), particularly in the stretch between Dempster Terrace and Greenside Place, where 73 were counted on the [21st of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159430616). Another flock of up to 50 birds inhabits [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), and there is presumably a significant amount of movement between sites around and beyond the patch. Most birds in town seem to be truly wild, but a small number of dumped domestic birds are also present in the main [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes) flock. Bred on the patch, with chicks seen at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes), and [Hepburn Gardens](site_accounts.qmd#hepburn-gardens).

Uncommon visitor, with records concentrated during the autumn passage season. Most reliably encountered on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east), but even there less common than in the inner Eden Estuary at Guardbridge or Coble Shore. Most records of single birds or small flocks of less than half a dozen birds, with a high count of 30 birds on the [13th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158767779) and again on the [27th of August](https://ebird.org/checklist/S192988182). Sporadically turns up at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), where a handful of birds lingered from the [29th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196847099) through til mid November. Odd records at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), and could probably turn up elsewhere in St Andrews Bay, or indeed anywhere on the patch with open water.

Last record for the spring on the [22nd of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169813245) at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head), and the first record for the autumn on the [28th of Septmber](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196705312) on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east). Most common in St Andrews Bay, especially off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with the a couple of records on the Eden Estuary. The highest count was of 42 birds off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159336429).

Although reliably present throughout the year, more abundant in the first winter period than the second (as with several other sea duck species), with much smaller flock sizes during the summer. The highest count was of 1880 birds on the [7th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158340273), with the highest count during the second winter period only 600 (on the [26th of November](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203664428)). Although present year-round, birds do not breed locally (with summer records presumably referring to non-breeding birds that did not return to their more northerly breeding sites).

Rare resident. Found in several parts of the patch, with the total population size perhaps up to half a dozen family groups. At least one group (maybe more) inhabits [St Andrews Links](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-links), another the field up behind [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), and a few more the fields south of town. Only ever seen in small family groups of up to 5 birds at once. Presumably bred locally, but no definitive observations (e.g. sightings of chicks) this year.

Common resident. Found in farmland all around the patch, with probably a mix of genuinely established feral birds and released/semi-tame birds (a few records of all-white domestic type birds support this theory). Records concentrated in and around the Balgove estate, especially around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond). More often recorded in spring, probably due to a combination of release timing and breeding season calling behaviour (although no definitive breeding behaviours observed). Generally recorded as single birds or small groups, with the high count of 18 birds (plus one all-white domestic type) in the field between the [Strathkinness High and Low Roads](site_accounts.qmd#strathkinness-high-to-strathkinness-low-roads) on the [13th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158759216).

Common resident. Less frequently observed during the winter months, but this is presumably due to changes in behaviour and detectability, rather than any exodus of birds locally. Found mainly in the rural parts of the patch, particularly in the vicinity of the Balgove estate (including [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) and [St Andrews Links](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-links)). Generally seen as single birds or pairs, with a couple of small flocks (the largest being of 8 birds, at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [22nd of October](https://ebird.org/checklist/S199839753) and [Balgove Farm](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-farm) on the [27th of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206726743)). A few records of pre-breeding behaviours including display and nest prospecting, but no definitive evidence of breeding (although presumably it did occur).

Common resident. Probably the most abundant resident species on the patch, easily observed no matter the location. Often seen in flocks of up to 100 birds at a time, with higher counts in the hundreds not particularly rare; the high count of 406 birds was a flock in the fields between [Swilken Burn and Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#swilken-burn-to-balgove-bay) on the [21st of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169661934). Rather surprisingly, no breeding behaviours observed, but birds almost certainly bred locally.

Common summer migrant. One of the last migrants to arrive in the spring, with the first record this year on the [10th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S173233509) at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond); similarly early to leave in the autumn, with the last record for the year on the [28th of August](https://ebird.org/checklist/S193029995) on [Saint Leonard's Road](site_accounts.qmd#saint-leonards-road). Commonly seen flying overhead all throughout the patch, either as individuals or in flocks of up to several dozen birds at a time; the highest count for the year was of 53 birds over [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [20th of July](https://ebird.org/checklist/S187906485). No breeding behaviours observed, although probably bred on the patch somewhere.

Probably underreported due to its cryptic nature, although given the scarcity of suitable habitat on the patch it is unlikely to be regular at any site locally.

Not abundant at any site, with generally no more than one or two pairs on a single water body; the highest count for the year was of 13 birds at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [1st of July](https://ebird.org/checklist/S184803013), although the majority of these were young birds.

Rare summer visitor. A perplexing species, entirely absent (despite seemingly suitable habitat and climate conditions) for the first half of the year, before a bird turned up unexpectedly at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [3rd of June](https://ebird.org/checklist/S179215499). A second bird arrived on the [14th of June](https://ebird.org/checklist/S181467571), and by the start of August they had bred on the pond, with two chicks seen with the adults on the [2nd of August](https://ebird.org/checklist/S189869249). Sightings continued on the pond until the [3rd of October](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197371440), after which they disappeared completely. It is unclear whether this seasonal breeding occurrence happens each year, or whether this was an isolated case unlikely to be repeated again any time soon.

Rare passage visitor. Despite the relative regularity of its Bar-tailed cousin on the patch, this species was recorded just once this year, a flock of 11 birds flying past [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [6th of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S167346185). This is made even more perplexing by the frequency with which birds are recorded further upstream on the Eden Estuary at Guardbridge - perhaps this disparity is reflective of my bad luck, or perhaps it reflects a real microhabitat preference displayed by this species in the area?

Rare visitor. One of the best birds of the year, and a very unexpected record - a single bird on [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) late in the evening of the [27th of August](https://ebird.org/checklist/S192988182). May well have occurred offshore later in the autumn, as is more typical for this species in Scotland, although the relative lack of storms (in comparison with 2023) meant that I did not pick any birds up.

All records between the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) and [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores), although could plausibly occur in suitable habitat elsewhere on the patch (such as the [East Sands Harbour](site_accounts.qmd#east-sands) or further along the [Coastal Path](site_accounts.qmd#coastal-path-from-st-andrews)).

Common winter visitor. Although recorded in almost all months of the year (May being the only blank month), probably better described as a winter migrant given the dramatic increase in numbers on the patch throughout the colder half of the year. Mostly restricted to the coastline between [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) and the [Coastal Path](site_accounts.qmd#coastal-path-from-st-andrews), with a couple of records around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) during wet periods when the meadow turns into a mire. Most abundant on the Eden Estuary, with a high count of 600 birds at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [27th of November](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203740391).

This is likely partly a result of missing most of September due to travel, and thus birds are probably more regular on the patch than the single record this year would suggest.

Rare winter visitor. Despite breeding just 25km away on the Isle of May, this species is paradoxically scarce in St Andrews Bay, with no records during the breeding season; birds seemingly avoid flying west into the Bay, opting to feed either further offshore or in the Firth of Forth. Nevertheless, several records in the latter months of the year, apparently part of a broader influx into the North Sea during this period. First recorded on the [26th of November](https://ebird.org/checklist/S203664428) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with a high count of three birds off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [14th of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205339551) and a final record on the [23rd of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206287426) also off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint).

Rare visitor. [Increasingly recorded in Fife in recent years](https://chatterstanes.wordpress.com/2024/01/04/black-guillemot-in-fife/), but still quite rare, and not at all regular in St Andrews Bay. Indeed, this was the final species added to the patch list for the year, with a single bird off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S205986039).

Common resident. The most frequently encountered alcid on the patch, with records in all but one month of the year, and birds being generally fairly reliable offshore in St Andrews Bay, particularly during calm periods with flat seas. Recorded mostly from [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) to [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock), with an unusual sighting in the Eden Estuary at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [4th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S171836610). Most abundant during autumn, when flocks of dozens of birds were observed multiple times, including a high count of 168 off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [23rd of July](https://ebird.org/checklist/S188393071). Did not breed on the patch itself, but young chicks seen offshore with adults in late summer and early autumn.

Rare visitor. Probably best described as a regular vagrant to the patch, with records generally coinciding with larger influxes of the species into the North Sea during winter storms. Three records this year, all in the second winter period and all off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), with the first on the [16th of November](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202659009) and the last on the [21st of December](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206062088).

Rare visitor. Only sporadically present on the patch, with no clear seasonal pattern although probably most likely to occur during autumn migration. Seen along the coast from [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) to [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores), often in association with periods of strong onshore winds. Numbers generally low, with a notable high count of 80 birds in a flock off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367).

Common summer visitor. Recorded on the patch in most months of the year, but much more abundant during summer and early autumn, with most winter records associated with storms. Exclusively coastal, with the majority of birds observed between [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) and [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock) (notwithstanding a couple of records in [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east)). Although mostly observed in small numbers or flocks up to 50 birds in size, post-breeding flocks in late summer tended to be much larger, with an exceptional high count of 1900 birds off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores) on the [26th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196556367).

The highest count was of 2700 birds on the [7th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158348660) at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) (part of the massive gull flock on the beach that afternoon), with several further counts of more than 100 birds recorded throughout the year. Birds bred on the patch at several locations, favouring the roofs of buildings for their nests; young chicks were seen throughout town between June and July.

Uncommon resident. Frequently recorded all along the coast from [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) to [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock) (with a handful of records at inland sites in addition), but never abundant, with a high count of just seven birds (noted three times throughout the year). Most reliable at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), where one or two birds almost always present on the rocks, and others often seen out to sea. Did not breed on the patch, with the closest breeding birds probably on the Isle of May.

Uncommon resident. Somewhat perplexing in its pattern of occurrence on the patch, birds do not seem to remain faithful to one site for any extended period of time, but rather move around extensively - perhaps in response to food availability or weather conditions. Recorded in most months of the year, but more frequently encountered in spring and summer, when a pair was present on [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) between March and October; these birds bred on the pond, with the chick first seen on the [24th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S176770856). Otherwise scarce, with a couple of autumn and winter records in St Andrews Bay, mostly near the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint).

Common winter migrant. The most frequently encountered grebe on the patch, being a regular fixture in St Andrews Bay throughout the colder months of the year. Last seen in the spring on the [21st of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169649756) at [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east), and first recorded in the autumn on the [30th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S197049462) off [The Scores](site_accounts.qmd#the-scores), with a couple of summer records in late July perhaps comprising failed breeders. Mostly seen in loose flocks of about half a dozen birds offshore, with a high count of 16 birds recorded in [early January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S157696637) off the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint).

Although not a patch breeder, present throughout the year (with summer records presumably comprising young birds or failed breeders). More abundant during migration periods, when large flocks occasionally stage offshore in St Andrews Bay, the largest this year being 39 birds off [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head) on the [6th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172362952).

Rare visitor. Despite breeding on the Isle of May just 25km away, and being common throughout much of the Fife coast, this species was very scarce in Fife this year, with just five records. Undoubtedly this is in large part due to the effects of the 2023-24 storm season, which saw the local population decimated; it will be interesting to see what happens to this species' occurrence on the patch in coming years as the population rebounds. Most records this year comprised individual birds, with a high count of four seen at the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [20th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S159336429).

::::::

Common resident. Seen throughout town, although mostly in the vicinity of [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), where a pair of birds were present throughout the year. More frequently encountered outside of summer, perhaps suggesting a change in the detectability of birds during the breeding season. No direct breeding evidence observed, although likely that birds did breed somewhere on the patch, perhaps in the woods behind the Balgove estate.

```
:::
::::::

Common resident. The most frequently encountered raptor on the patch, seen throughout the year and in most parts of town (although more common in the more wooded north-west and southern edge). No definitive evidence of breeding on the patch, but the continual presence of a pair of birds around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) throughout the year, and the juvenile bird seen several times near the pond during autumn would suggest that breeding did occur somewhere nearby, perhaps in the woods behind the Balgove estate.

Rare visitor. Almost certainly more regular on the patch than records suggest, but only observed twice - both records comprising individual birds out hunting on separate evenings. The first bird was seen hunting over stubble fields by the [Strathkinness Low Road](b939-buchanan-gardens-and-strathkinness-low-road) on the [23rd of October](https://ebird.org/checklist/S200014845), while the second bird was on the field up behind [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on [Christmas night](https://ebird.org/checklist/S206563196).

Uncommon resident. Probably several pairs throughout the patch, but only irregularly encountered given their nocturnal habits. Most records from near home, including four birds observed on the night of the [14th of November](https://ebird.org/checklist/S202501268), likely comprising a family group of adults and young.

:::
::::::

Rare resident. A secretive inhabitant of aquatic habitats around town, with birds observed on [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), on the Kinness Burn by [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes), and along the coastline from the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) to [Maiden Rock](site_accounts.qmd#maiden-rock). Conspicuously absent throughout most of the summer, so perhaps did not breed locally, but may well have also just bred secretively somewhere on the patch. Usually just seen singly, with a couple of sightings of a pair at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond).

:::
::::::

Uncommon resident. Present throughout most of the woods around town, particularly in the north-west around the Balgove estate. No definitive breeding evidence, but almost certainly breeds locally given this species' sedentary nature and the regularity of sightings throughout the year. Mostly seen singly, with a couple of sightings of two birds: on the [23rd of April](https://ebird.org/checklist/S169902506) along [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes), and on the [5th of May](https://ebird.org/checklist/S172094983) by [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond).

Uncommon visitor. Probably more common (and likely resident) just outside town, with several records on the outskirts of the patch in farmland, although birds not regular at any one site on the patch. Seen throughout the year, although only in eight months, and only ever one bird at a time.

::::::

Rare visitor. It is difficult to say with certainty what this species' status on the patch is, given the somewhat perplexing pattern of occurrence throughout the year. The majority of records of the species came from [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) during autumn and winter, with two birds present around the pond from early October to the end of the year; the same pattern of occurrence in late 2023 at the pond suggests this may be a regular annual occurrence. In addition, two birds were seen in [Lumbo Den](site_accounts.qmd#lumbo-den) on the [1st of June](https://ebird.org/checklist/S178540214); given how infrequently I birded in these woods throughout the year they may be more regular there, but it is hard to say with certainty whether birds are resident in the patch or whether they just move through from time to time.

::::::

Common resident. Present throughout the year and all across the patch, with birds being particularly abundant in parks, gardens and rural areas (mostly avoiding the most built up parts of town, as well as the Eden Estuary and St Andrews Bay). Generally seen in ones or twos, with occasional small flocks of up to 10 birds (the high count for the year coming on the [13th of January](https://ebird.org/checklist/S158758506) along [Buchanan Gardens](site_accounts.qmd#b939-buchanan-gardens-and-strathkinness-low-road)).

Common resident. Although less abundant than [Eurasian Jackdaw](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-jackdaw) or [Carrion Crow](species_accounts.qmd#carrion-crow), nevertheless a common bird around town, with at least two active rookeries on the patch: one in the trees by Eden Clubhouse (on the [golf course](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-links)), and another in the trees around Mill Pond (along the [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes)). Often seen in flocks, with the largest flock of the year numbering 111 birds on [West Sands](site_accounts.qmd#west-sands) on the [10th of February](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161076110).

Common resident. One of the most common birds in town, being seen in all parts of the patch and in all months of the year, often in large numbers. The largest flock of the year comprised 161 birds near [Balgove Bay](site_accounts.qmd#balgove-bay-east) on the [29th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196855128); counts of more than 50 birds were also recorded at [Out Head](site_accounts.qmd#out-head), the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint), and [West Sands](site_accounts.qmd#west-sands). Birds bred in several locations around the patch, with nesting behaviours seen near [David Russell Apartments](site_accounts.qmd#david-russell-apartments-to-swilken-burn), [Doubledykes Road](site_accounts.qmd#doubledykes-road), the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory), [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond), and the [golf course](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-links).

Rare winter visitor. Present around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) during the first couple of months of the year, with up to three birds seen throughout January and February (the final record coming on the [18th of February](https://ebird.org/checklist/S161956481)); records at the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory) and along [Lade Braes](site_accounts.qmd#lade-braes) during this period probably referred to the same birds wandering around town. Not seen again until November, when a pair of birds flew past the [Aquarium](site_accounts.qmd#aquarium-viewpoint) on the [5th](https://ebird.org/checklist/S201454703).

Common resident. Although less abundant than [Great](species_accounts.qmd#great-tit) or [Blue](species_accounts.qmd#eurasian-blue-tit) Tits, nevertheless a common bird throughout the patch, particularly favouring stands of conifers such as those around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) or the [Observatory](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-observatory). More frequently seen during the winter period, although unclear whether this is reflective of an influx of migrants from further afield, or changes in the detectability of local resident birds. Birds bred on the patch, with chicks seen at the [Sports Centre](site_accounts.qmd#st-andrews-sports-centre) on the [8th of June](https://ebird.org/checklist/S180071700) and at [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [1st of July](https://ebird.org/checklist/S184803013). The high count of the year was of just seven birds, seen around [North Haugh Pond](site_accounts.qmd#north-haugh-pond) on the [29th of September](https://ebird.org/checklist/S196847099).
